# What is this?

Sanctioned is a Repo for a platform for reporting fraud and abuse of cryptocurrencies. It will first take form as a Telegram bot (possibly riot/status as well), which logs evidence of fraud and abuse, and then automatically collects, structures and efficiently assembles information in a format needed for the filing and management of a class action suit against a fraudulent ICO or Cryptocurrency
